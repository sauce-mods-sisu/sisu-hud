SISU HUD - Minimalist HUD 
=========================


## Installing
------------------
A Sauce for Zwift "Mod" is a directory placed in `~/Documents/SauceMods`.  NOTE: "Documents"
may be called "My Documents" on some platforms.  For first time mod users they should create
an empty **SauceMods** folder first.  Then each Mod will be a sub directory in there such as...
```
Documents
└── SauceMods
    ├── <Put me here>
```

## Usage
------------------
### Basic Features
-Turn the mod on in Sauce Settings.
-The window is draggable by the top config bar to place
-The window is resizable by the bottom right-hand corner green box "resizeHandle"
-Icons can be dragged into the order you want and will be saved
-Right-clicking will make a stat visible that you don't care about
-In the config bar you can "Reset Visibility" to see all stats

## Known Issues
------------------
- Time on Course is weird ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
- All things are in metric because metric is just better (will fix as inclined)
 - p.s. you should be in metric because you get more xp! (20 per km, vs 30 per mile, conversion is 1.62 km per mile)
- Bounding box and disappearing resizeHandle (square box)


## FAQ
==================================================
### 1. Why call it SISU HUD?
Sisu means 'go' in Finnish but more importantly it's the team I race with, I both wanted to celebrate them and make our opponents have to see our name everywhere!!! https://www.sisu.racing/

### 2. What problem does SISU HUD solve?
I have Zwift on a TV and was in a Team Time Trial (TTT) recently, we had scheduled pulls every 30 seconds.  I found it impossible to concentrate on my w/kg AND see the time remaining in my pull.  I was also a professional poker player in a former life and we had HUDs that displayed opponent's stats which was the main inspiration for SISU HUD, to place all relevant data right on your avatar (or whever you like).  

### 3. Where is ideal placement of the HUD on Zwift?
I look forward to the creative ways the community uses this, I recommend placing in very near to your rider/avatar.  I think it's important to watch your rider as closely as possible during races to pick up cues from your competitors and to maximize the draft.  Having all of your relevant data nearer your focal point solves the problem of split attention.

## Future Features
------------------
- More stats : Gradient, distance to banner, ??
- Font Selection
- Support for Imperial and/or your Zwift setting (if I can get to it)
- Color gradients corresponding to ranges for some stats like wBal or whatnot
- Maybe way off in the distant future the ability to have multiple windows and pin to riders
